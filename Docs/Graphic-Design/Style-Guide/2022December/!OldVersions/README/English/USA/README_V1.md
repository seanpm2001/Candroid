## Graphic Design / Style Guide

### 2022 December edition

This section of the documentation goes over documentation for the process of designing Candroid logos and banners from 2022 November to 2022 December. It is the first design style guide for the Candroid project.

The current guides are incomplete. Community collaboration is welcome. We are currently looking for a rewritten style guide for:

- Krita
- Inkscape
- Pinta
